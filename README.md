# Applied Deep Reinforcement Learning: From Theory to Emergence

## Project Overview and Motivation

This repository serves as a practical research portfolio documenting my progression into Deep Reinforcement Learning. Currently completing a double Master's degree in Applied Mathematics (MAS) and Digital Sciences for Sport (SNS), I am actively seeking a Ph.D. opportunity in Reinforcement Learning and Multi-Agent Systems starting September 2026.

## Research Interests

My primary research interest lies in the emergence of complex behaviors in multi-agent environments (MARL). I am particularly fascinated by how simple interaction rules can lead to sophisticated strategies—such as tool use or auto-curricula—without explicit programming.

I am currently focusing on:
* **Emergent Complexity:** Understanding how competitive and cooperative environments drive agents to discover unintended strategies.
* **Generalization:** Exploring methods to prevent overfitting to specific level layouts, allowing agents to adapt to unseen dynamic environments.
* **Simulated Environments:** Using video games and physics engines as rigorous proxies for real-world decision-making problems.

## Current Project: Predator-Prey Environment

A minimal 1v1 adversarial environment where a predator learns to catch prey using PPO. Implements reward shaping to study emergent pursuit and evasion behaviors. Built with Gymnasium and Stable-Baselines3 for clean experimentation with multi-agent dynamics.

## Literature Review

To ground my work in theory, I maintain an annotated bibliography of foundational and state-of-the-art papers. This includes works on DQN, PPO, Multi-Agent Autocurricula, and Generalization.

I am open to discussion regarding research opportunities, thesis proposals, or academic collaboration.
